0.1.0 - 2021/11/27

Crate renamed exempi2.

Lots of API have changed, even though they are not fundamentally different.

- API: Xmp C types are wrapped into a tuple instead of named field in struct.
- API: Flags are now defined using bitflags 1.5.0 and therefor namespaced into
  their struct.
- API: Flags values are now simplified to not duplicate the namespace.
- API: Error is now its own type and support the Error protocol.
- API: Overal rework of the API to take `AsPtr<>` whenever applicable:
  - `AsPtr<OsStr>` for file path
  - `AsPtr<[u8]>` for strings
- API: make `XmpIterator` an `Iterator`.
- API: `From<XmpString>` for `String`.
- API: removed `init()` from public API. It is called automatically. Removed
  `forced_init()` and `terminate()`.
- API: Renamed `XmpTzSign` to `TzSign`.
- Now the crate use Rust 2018.
- Fixed some Rust deprecation warnings: range in patterns and Sync::Once.
